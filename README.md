## 📁 Project Structure

### 1. 🧼 Data Cleaning Project
**Objective:**  
Clean and standardize a raw dataset with missing values, duplicates, incorrect data types, and inconsistent formatting.

**Techniques Used:**
- Handling missing data (mean, median, drop)
- Removing duplicates
- Converting data types
- String formatting and trimming
- Date and time conversion

**Tools:** `pandas`, `numpy`

### 2. ⚙️ Data Preprocessing Project
**Objective:**  
Prepare clean data for machine learning algorithms by transforming features and labels.

**Techniques Used:**
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Encoding categorical variables (OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder)
- Train-test split
- Data balancing (optional: SMOTE)

**Tools:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`

### 3. 📈 Data Visualization Project
**Objective:**  
Understand the dataset using visual exploration techniques and identify patterns or anomalies.

**Techniques Used:**
- Histograms, box plots, scatter plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Pair plots
- Class distribution graphs

**Tools:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`


---

### 4. 🧠 Model Compilation & Training Project
**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning or deep learning model, compile it with appropriate configurations, and train it on prepared data.

**Steps Covered:**
- Defining a model (ML or DL)
- Choosing loss function, optimizer, metrics
- Model training with validation
- Accuracy and loss plots

**Tools:** `scikit-learn`, `keras` / `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`


---

### 5. 🔍 Evaluation & Testing
**Objective:**  
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC-AUC (for classification)
